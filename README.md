# Blockchain-Based Hotel Reservation Management

## Overview

The Blockchain-Based Hotel Reservation Management system revolutionizes the hospitality industry by removing intermediaries, reducing fees, and enhancing trust between hotels and guests. This decentralized platform leverages smart contracts to automate and secure every aspect of the hotel booking process, from property verification to payment settlement.

## Core Components

### Property Verification Contract
Validates legitimate accommodation providers through digital identity verification, business license checks, property documentation, and guest reviews. This ensures only authentic properties can list their inventory on the platform, protecting guests from fraud and misrepresentation.

### Inventory Management Contract
Tracks available room inventory in real-time using blockchain technology to maintain a single source of truth. Hotels can update room availability, pricing, and details through a secure interface, with all changes recorded on the blockchain for transparency and audit purposes.

### Booking Contract
Manages reservations and cancellation policies through immutable smart contracts. When a guest books a room, the contract automatically locks the inventory, issues a digital booking confirmation, and enforces the agreed-upon terms including cancellation windows and refund policies.

### Payment Processing Contract
Handles deposits and final payments using cryptocurrency or tokenized fiat currency. The contract securely holds guest deposits in escrow until check-in, automates final payment collection, and instantly settles with the hotel upon successful stay completion, eliminating payment delays and disputes.
